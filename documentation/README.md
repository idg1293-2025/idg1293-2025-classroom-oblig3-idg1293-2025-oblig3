### PROJECT OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE:
We decided to create a new webside for the SDGs Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. 

The purpose of the page is to give the reader the same information as they can get on the SDG page, but in a more engaging way and with a bit simpler language. Our goal is to make the information less overwhelming, and at the same time create an engaging page with animations to keep the readers attention through the whole page.

### BRAINSTORMING SESSION:
We knew from the beginning that we wanted to create a simple and clean page, but at the same time show everything we've learned so far. We looked at the SDG's and agreed that Goal 6 seemed the most interesting, and we quickly came up with the idea about the drop at the start of the page. After this we brainstormed around how the rest of the layout should be, and came up with ideas about the animations and implementations we wanted to add to make the information engaging.

### STORYBOARD:
After the brainstorming session, we created a storyboard to show how our page will look in the end. The image of the storyboard is saved as ![storyboard](storyboard.png) in the documentation folder. We tried to make it with detailed descriptions and drawing, but without making the drawing too detailed.
