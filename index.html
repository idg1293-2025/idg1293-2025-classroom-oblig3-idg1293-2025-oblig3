        <h1 class="scene1__title">Goal 14: Life Below Water</h1>
        <p class="scene1__text">Did you know that oceans cover more than 70% of our planet? 
            They're like the Earth's life support system, providing food and homes for billions of people and animals. 
        </p>

    <!-- Scene 2: Water - The ocean's beauty -->
    <section class="scene2 mb">
        <p class="scene2__text">
            Beneath the waves is an underwater paradise — coral reefs, sparkling fish, and all kinds of creatures. 
            The ocean regulates our climate, provides food, and is home to amazing ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p class="scene2__text">
            Let's dive in and see what’s going on beneath the surface!

    <!-- Scene 3: Pollution - The threats -->
    <section class="scene3 mb">

        <p class="scene3__text">
            But things are changing and the oceans are in trouble. 
        </p>
        <p class="scene3__text">
            The ocean isn't the beautiful place it once was. Pollution is everywhere: 
            plastic waste, oil spills, abandoned fishing nets. 
        </p>
        <p class="scene3__text">
            Every year, millions of tons of plastic end up in the ocean, harming fish, coral reefs, and even the air we breathe.
        </p>

    <!-- Scene 4: Call to action-->
    <section class="scene4 mb">

        <p class="scene4__text">
            It’s time to act. Together, we can make a real difference and protect the ocean for future generations.
        </p>
        <p class="scene4__text">
            So, what can you do? 
        </p>
        <p class="scene4__text">
            We can all make a difference! Use less plastic, support eco-friendly brands, and get involved in beach cleanups. Every small action counts!
        </p>
        <p class="scene4__text">
            Ocean acidification (Target 14.3) is getting worse, and illegal fishing (Target 14.6) is threatening marine ecosystems. By taking action, 
            we can help protect our oceans for future generations
        </p>
        <p class="scene4__text">
            The ocean needs us more than ever, and together, we can make a real impact. Let’s step up and show some love for the sea!
