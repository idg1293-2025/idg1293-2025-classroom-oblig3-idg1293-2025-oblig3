Goal 6
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

"Half the world experiences severe water scarcity every year — and the number is growing."

Target 6.1: 
By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all

Target 6.2:
By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations

Target 6.3:
By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally

Target 6.4:
By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity

Target 6.5:
By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate

Target 6.6:
By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes

Target 6.a:
By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies

Target 6.b:
Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management


The Clock Is Ticking on SDG 6 

Despite progress in some areas, the world is falling dangerously behind on Sustainable Development Goal 6. As of 2022, not a single SDG 6 target is on track to be met.

	• 2.2 billion people still lack access to safely managed drinking water.
	• 3.5 billion people live without safely managed sanitation.
	• Between 2002 and 2021, droughts affected over 1.4 billion people.
	• In 2022, half of the global population experienced severe water scarcity, and one in four faced extremely high water stress.

Nearly 40% of the world’s population lives in river and lake basins that cross national borders. Yet, fewer than 20% of countries have effective agreements to manage these shared waters. Without cooperation, both people and planet suffer.

Access to water and sanitation is improving, but not quickly enough to meet 2030 goals—progress must accelerate 3 to 6 times faster.

Wastewater treatment is increasing, yet only 60% is safely treated, and water quality is declining where monitoring is most advanced.

Water use is more efficient, but global water stress is rising, especially in vulnerable regions.

Integrated water management remains slow—just 57% implementation globally, and many countries still lack agreements on shared waters.

While surface water has grown overall, some regions face dangerous losses due to drought and overuse.

Funding is finally rising again, with water sector aid up 10% in 2022, reversing a five-year dip.

We Can’t Afford to Wait
The message is clear: progress is possible, but not at the current pace. Without bold, coordinated global action, millions will continue to live without the most basic of human rights—clean water and sanitation. It’s time to prioritize integrated water management, climate adaptation, and cross-border cooperation.

Water is life. Let’s act like it.
